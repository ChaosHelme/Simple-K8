# Simple-k8

## Overview

Simple-k8 is a C# project that simulates the core concepts of Kubernetes on a basic level. This project is not intended to be a Kubernetes implementation or replacement, but rather a personal learning tool to better understand the key concepts and workings of Kubernetes.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To provide a simplified model of Kubernetes components and their interactions
2. To serve as a learning resource for those interested in understanding Kubernetes internals
3. To experiment with implementing container orchestration concepts in C#

## Features

Simple-k8 implements basic simulations of the following Kubernetes concepts:

- API Server
- Pods
- Nodes (Worker and Control)
- Deployments
- Services
- Scheduling
- Load Balancing
